# Installing Python packages

#
# Notes for Python 2.7:
# ---------------------
#  - all version numbers are considered to be frozen;
#  - virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper and friends are installed for for both
#    Python 2 and Python 3 as they rae used when virtual environments are
#    build for the respective python; however, the Python 2 version is 
#    later on as that makes the installed executable/shell script to install
#    Python 2 virtual environments by default;
#  - numpy and scipy are installed via pip, not brew (which doesn't support 
#    Python 2 any more);
#  - some special cases are treated outside of the requirements file below
#    as they require special environment variable settings or similar;
#  # pip utilities (pip-date, pip-chill, ...) are installed for Python 3.
